# @ng-bucket/local-store
This package allows to create local component state, which lives as long as component.
It concept is based on [NgRx](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) (but does not require it).

I hope one day I will be able to deprecated this libraries in favor to native solutions :wink: until then
